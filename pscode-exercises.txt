// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
Ask for 1st number
Ask for 2nd number
Add number 1 to number 2
Print Answer


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Ask for number
Divide number by 2
If answer is a whole number, it is even, print "Even"
Else it is odd, print "Odd"



// Exercise 3:
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five
entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message
describing what they are

Ask for number 1 (a)
Ask for number 2 (b)
Ask for number 3 (c)
Ask for number 4 (d)
Ask for number 5 (e)
variable f = sum of integers a + b + C + d + e
print "Determining sum of submitted values."
print "Sum = " + f
variable g = f / 5
"Print Determining average of submitted values by dividing the sum of values by the number of values"
print "Average = " + g
Turn the variables into a list [a, b, c, d, e]
Define a function to determine the min and max values (i.e. is value b less than value a? if no, value a is min and do this through value a - e)
Call your function and point it to your list
Print the min and max value
